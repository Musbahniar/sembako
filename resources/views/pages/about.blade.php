    Food security is one of the main priorities of the national development program considering that food has strategic values related to the most basic needs of society and aspects of social security, economic stability, political stability and security. In this connection, it is felt that there is a need to develop a Strategic Food Price Information Center (PIHPS) as one part of strengthening food security programs to achieve the ultimate goal of increasing and equitable distribution of people's welfare.

    The lack of reliable food price information will affect the efficiency of decisions taken by economic actors at the national and regional levels. The accumulation of negative public expectations due to asymmetric information has the potential to cause price fluctuations, which in turn are feared to affect macroeconomic stability. Unclear and lack of integration of price information will also affect the stability of food prices. In addition to the long distribution chain, lack of integrated and reliable information also causes widening price disparities.
